    "Playing with different formats for mostly mistral models. Using Together via the `/inference` endpoint we can bypass their prompt formatting for instruct/chat models and have more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means there's still the control and instructing of these models, but we can also part-fill their responses to guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, just use the base models and ignore the instruction tuning completely. There's still a lot of non-instruct style things that can be done with the instruction tuned models, but their logit distributions are altered from the base and it's not yet clear in what ways this is better or worse for extracting the best reasoning and knoweledge from them if you don't need to have structured conversations...this is still a research question."
