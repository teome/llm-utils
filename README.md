# LLM-Utils

Utility library, scripts, tokenization implementation and comparisons, and a barebones gradio UI for chatting to various LLM endpoints.

Includes
- Tokenization that's more correct than that provided by the majority of OSS libraries
- A minimal Gradio UI for OpenAI library compatible endpoints and those that provide a REST API meaning that many of the open source and community models can be used with e.g. vLLM
