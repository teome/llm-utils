      "There is a lineage to Metalheadz that I think is important to stress here. Everybody knows Goldie and Kemistry & Storm from way back when, so it’s a great place for this tale to begin. But let me take you as far back as 1987 with all my Sinister DJ dates on pirate radio. You see, I had a crew called Sinister — me, DJ Phantasy and MC Fats — and we used to go around playing at all the illegal raves (Camelot, Biology, Fantasia, Rave FM) and also doing pirate radio. We were all doing normal jobs at the time, but we were all really into this music. So one day I got this call saying “do you want to come and play at Genesis?” I was like wow! Genesis was incredible — it was unbelievable! It went on forever, it was just an amazing rave. And then after that we started doing more pirate radio, and kiddy raves… just doing whatever we could do without getting caught. That’s when Goldie started out as a DJ too – so we go way back!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bumped into Steve [Goldie] at a club called Maximus in East London about ‘92 and he said “Darren, I’m gonna be doing a hip-hop label and I wanna make a tune.” This was his first ever Vinyl release and it was with a guy called Chris who lived next door to him, and Dizzy for the scratches. They made three tunes together which resulted in the “Smokescreen” EP. I did some turntable cuts over those tracks, you know, records scratched in. He loved them so much that he put them on the release. To be honest though the tunes were quite weak, but they still managed to sell like crazy! Before this he didn’t know anything about production or engineering or even EQ-ing, so I took him under my wing and taught him everything there was to know about how to do his own thing. In return, due to our friendship, I asked Steve to help me with my own project, a label I was working on called Aries. He loved what I was doing, and decided to help reach the audience that I wanted to reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway – back to Metalheadz. The first track we worked on was KJK [“Terminator”], a tune that was made by John Jones, one of the guys who wrote/engineered “Heaven and Earth,” which was Goldie’s first track. That was done at Rupert Parkes’ [the artist Photek] studio. They ran the record labels FFRR and Dedicated and kept Rupert, Goldie, and myself in a little room full of keyboards and a bunch of analogue equipment including tape machines and 16 channels per track. I had my 3001 reverb unit at home that I’d bought off Brian Eno which Goldie would borrow from time to time. I had a lot of equipment and could work it, because of my background in audio engineering you see. Goldie would bounce his tunes around my house and I’d make them sound good, and he would stay there until 6am every morning working on his music. He said to himself “fuck this, I’m going to bring everybody who can make things sound better than they do themselves over to my house and get them to make stuff right now!” There wasn’t anything else out at this time like this. What he was doing was new.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time I played him some drums at Ableton Live and Goldie said “Wow! What are these drums? Where does that shit come from?! I have never heard anything like it before – it’s fucking good!” I said “Well, it’s been around for a few years,” but since he saw I was always pushing the boundaries he added it to his new label, Metalheadz, as the first two releases – “Angels Fell” and “Terminator”… and the rest is history. Can you imagine being able to make this unique sound like that back then? It was amazing. Previously that kind of stuff was only heard in the studio with pro audio equipment running through a desk — not on a computer screen. Having a computer makes this stuff run for real. We’ll talk more later about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other big move for us was when we did a demo tape — and it wasn’t actually a tape, but a floppy disk — and they played it on Kiss FM. Back then you had to send in your demo CD or tape on a box and they would send out a runner to go and collect it. One day Steve told them “nah just bring me a floppy\n"

      "10 years ago, when there was a glut of drum and bass records flooding into every shop in the world, Goldie decided to do something different with his label: he wanted to take it all back underground. One way of doing this was to change the way the records sounded: instead of keeping to the same formulae as everyone else, Metalheadz went for a more minimal, atmospheric vibe that was low on flashy production and high on soul. Even more prominant was the way Goldie altered the release schedule of the label, only putting out one or two releases at a time before making everyone stop and wait until the next record came along. Release dates were announced then changed, then scrapped altogether. It wasn't uncommon for Metalheadz releases to slowly build up into batches of 5 or so; all carefully timed so that they would get maximum attention from the public because each record became an event in itself. The entire drum n bass scene started to revolve around these releases in the same way that the early hip hop scene had been hypnotised by the 12\" releases on pioneering labels like Sugarhill and Tommy Boy. By 1996, Metalheadz success peaked with the release of the classic Platinum Breakz EP (a collection of brilliantly minimal Aphex Twin-inspired tracks) and Goldie's album Timeless. Goldie was now also a celebrity musician in the outside world who drew attention to the label and brought some much needed innovation to the world of drum n bass both commercially (with you sell out?) and artistically (with Timeless). Drum and Bass was now the biggest dance music genre. Metalheadz, being first out of the gates, were at its forefront.\n",
      "But then, just as things were getting really good, they hit a stumbling block. Before Goldie could finish producing his follow up album, \"Saturns Return\", he was offered a part in the movie \"The World Is Not Enough\" playing the role of a Bond villian (it's rumored that Bjork put him up for the part). He took it and the followup album was put on hold while he went off to make a movie. With no new material coming through on the Metalheadz front, the other labels on the scene started to put out more and more records, many fans started buying music again from labels like Innovation Records, and Goldie stopped being able to control the drum n bass scene with his releases. By the time Jill Dread left Metalheadz to set up her own label in 1998, the scene was already suffering under the weight of too many records and bands fighting over the rights to be heard. With his celebrity status thorugh the media, Goldie had become too successful for his own good. The Metalheadz machine started to lose momentum rapidly after 1997 and by the end of 1998, the label didn't even release any records anymore! In early 2001, I was still stuck in mourning for the halcyon days of Metalheadz. The label had been forgotten by most people and seemed to be lost forever. But then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere came the news: Goldie did finish his Saturnz Return album and Gilles Peterson was re-launching his Talking Loud label....and Metalheadz had a new home. Maybe the label might rise again?\n",
      "I don't think anyone expected the upcoming schedule to be as impressive as it has been though. As far as I can tell, Goldie is now free to release as many records as he likes without having to worry about the costs involved because Talking Loud will help him out financially. This means that more than ever, Metalheadz can get back to doing what it does best: controlling the scene by releasing one track at a time. In the past few months, we've seen more Metalheadz records come out than usual in a long time and unless my eyes are deceiving me, it looks like they have no intention of stopping anytime soon; if everything works out properly, maybe Golden will even be able to put out his full album for us...this time!\n",
      "So anyway, that brings us roughly up to date. Here's my loooong review of the new Metalheadz EP's:\n",
